All requirements have been completed. 

Bugs: 
	-the light is much darker switching between the two scenes. If you start the scenes normally without switching then the light is fine 
	-she also walks through trees and I can't figure out why
	

To move the character:
	-Up arrow walks forward
	-right arrow turns right
	-left arrow turns left

The 1 and 2 buttons are used to toggle between the two game feel gardens. 

In the scene labeled M2 the character is able to push the balls around and interact with them. When she hits the gold pole in the middle of the screen then the character dies and she turns into a ragdoll. The balls can also cause the gold pole to fall over. Bump into the gold pole to see her turn into a ragdoll. 

In the scene labeled GameFeelGarden1 the character can interact with the crates by pushing them and the balls by rolling them. This enviroment has a wind effect with wind sound. There are also skeleton ragdolls that the character can interact with on the ground. There are mounds in the shape of stars for the character to climb and push 


Built with OSX.

The main scene is M2.
